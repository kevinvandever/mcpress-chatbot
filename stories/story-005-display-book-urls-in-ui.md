# Story: Display Book URLs in UI Components

## Story
**ID**: STORY-005  
**Title**: Display Book URLs in UI Components  
**Status**: Completed

As a user, I want to see and click MC Press website links when books are referenced so that I can easily navigate to purchase or learn more about the books directly from the MC Press store.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Book URLs are displayed in chat responses when sources are cited
- [x] Book URLs are displayed in the document listing cards in the left panel
- [x] URLs are clickable and open in a new tab
- [x] Links have appropriate styling (color, underline, hover effects)
- [x] Links are only shown when URL exists (no broken links for missing URLs)
- [x] Link text is user-friendly (e.g., "View on MC Press" or book title as link)
- [x] Links have proper accessibility attributes

## Dev Notes
- Depends on STORY-003 and ideally STORY-004 being completed
- Need to update multiple components that display book information
- Consider creating a reusable BookLink component
- Ensure consistent link styling across all locations

## Testing
- Test links in chat response source citations
