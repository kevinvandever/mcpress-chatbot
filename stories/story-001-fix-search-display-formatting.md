# Story: Fix Search Result Display Card Formatting

## Story
**ID**: STORY-001  
**Title**: Fix Search Result Display Card Formatting  
**Status**: In Progress

As a user searching the MC Press chatbot, I want the enlarged image and text display cards to be properly formatted so that I can easily read and understand the search results.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] When clicking to enlarge a search result card, the text is properly formatted with appropriate spacing and line breaks
- [ ] Images in enlarged view maintain proper aspect ratio and don't overflow the modal/popup
- [ ] Code blocks (if present) are displayed with proper syntax highlighting and formatting
- [ ] Long text content is wrapped appropriately and doesn't extend beyond the card boundaries
- [ ] The enlarged view has proper padding and margins for readability
- [ ] Font sizes are appropriate for the enlarged view
- [ ] Close button or escape functionality works properly

## Dev Notes
- Current issue: After searching and clicking to enlarge, the data formatting is poor
- Check components: SearchInterface.tsx, and any modal/popup components
- Consider if the issue is with how the data is parsed from chunks or how it's displayed
- May need to handle different content types (text, code, images) differently

## Testing
- Search for various terms that return different content types
- Test with results containing:
  - Plain text
  - Code snippets  
  - Images
  - Mixed content
- Test on different screen sizes
- Verify readability improvements

## Tasks
- [x] Investigate current search result card implementation in SearchInterface.tsx
- [x] Identify the component handling the enlarged view
- [x] Analyze current formatting issues with different content types
- [x] Implement proper formatting for text content
  - [x] Add proper line breaks and paragraph spacing
  - [x] Implement text wrapping
  - [x] Set appropriate font sizes
- [x] Fix image display in enlarged view
  - [x] Maintain aspect ratios
  - [x] Implement max-width/height constraints
  - [x] Add proper image containers
- [x] Handle code block formatting
  - [x] Apply syntax highlighting if not present
  - [x] Use monospace fonts
  - [x] Add horizontal scrolling if needed
- [x] Add proper styling for the enlarged view container
  - [x] Padding and margins
  - [x] Background and borders
  - [x] Shadow/overlay effects
- [x] Test all content type combinations
- [x] Ensure responsive design works
