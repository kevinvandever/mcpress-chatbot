## Issues Identified

Based on user feedback, we have the following remaining issues to fix:

### 1. **Document Count Issue** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Problem**: Frontend shows "200 documents loaded" instead of 6,270+
- **Root Cause**: Missing LIMIT clause removal in `list_documents()` method
- **Solution**: Removed LIMIT clause in `backend/vector_store_postgres.py`
- **Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED AND WORKING** - Now shows 6,270 documents

### 2. **Article Titles Show ID Numbers** ❌  
- **Problem**: Articles display "4247", "5765", "5805" instead of proper article titles
- **Root Cause**: Articles were migrated to `books` table but titles weren't properly updated from Excel metadata
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, articles not identifiable

### 3. **Articles Show "Unknown Author"** ❌
- **Problem**: Most articles still show "Unknown Author" instead of real author names
- **Root Cause**: Author associations weren't properly created during metadata import
- **Impact**: Missing attribution, no author links

### 4. **Author Button Hover Dropdown Not Working** ❌
- **Problem**: Purple "Author" button doesn't show dropdown on hover
- **Root Cause**: CSS hover state or JavaScript issue in CompactSources.tsx
- **Impact**: Users can't access author websites

### 5. **Read Button URL Typo** ❌
- **Problem**: URLs have "https://ww.mcpressonline.com" instead of "https://www.mcpressonline.com"
- **Root Cause**: Source Excel data has typo with missing "w" in "www"
- **Impact**: Read buttons don't work, broken links

## Fix Plan

### **Fix 1: Document Count Issue**

**Problem**: Frontend shows 200 documents instead of 6,270+

**Solution**: Update the `/documents` endpoint to return the correct count from both `documents` and `books` tables.

**Files to modify**:
- `backend/vector_store_postgres.py` - Update `list_documents()` method
- Ensure it counts all documents from both tables

### **Fix 2: Article Titles and Authors**

**Problem**: Articles show ID numbers and "Unknown Author"

**Solution**: The metadata import worked, but we need to verify the enrichment is using the correct data.

**Investigation needed**:
- Check if `books.title` was properly updated from Excel Column B
- Check if author associations were created in `document_authors` table
- Verify enrichment function is using the right data

### **Fix 3: Author Button Dropdown**

**Problem**: Purple "Author" button hover doesn't work

**Solution**: Fix the CSS hover state in CompactSources.tsx

**Files to modify**:
- `frontend/components/CompactSources.tsx` - Fix hover dropdown functionality

### **Fix 4: URL Typo Fix**

**Problem**: URLs have "ww" instead of "www"

**Solution**: Run a database update to fix all article URLs

**Action**: SQL update to replace "https://ww.mcpressonline.com" with "https://www.mcpressonline.com"
