# MC Press Chatbot: Competitive Analysis

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Analyst:** Tara (Business Analyst)
**Purpose:** Evaluate competitive landscape for technical AI chatbots and identify MC Press Chatbot's differentiation opportunities

---

## Executive Summary

The MC Press Chatbot enters a rapidly evolving market dominated by general-purpose AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Tabnine) and enterprise chatbots (ChatGPT Enterprise, Claude for Work). However, **no competitor specializes in IBM i/AS400/RPG development** with proprietary content integration and e-commerce capabilities.

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate Priorities (Pre-Launch)**

Focus on David's Score 1 features to achieve competitive parity:

✅ **Already Covered:**
- File Upload & Analysis (Story 006, 007)
- Code Generation (Story 008, 009)
- Conversation History (Story 011, 012)

⚠️ **Clarify with David:**
- Smart Notifications (Score 0 or 1?) - If 1, add to MVP
- Mobile App (Score 0?) - If exists, highlight in positioning

### 2. **Post-Launch Differentiation (Score 2 Features)**

Prioritize features that competitors lack:

🎯 **Highest Impact:**
1. **Analytics & Insights Dashboard** - Justifies $20/month with ROI data
2. **Project Management** - Increases daily usage and stickiness
3. **Learning Paths with IBM i Focus** - Unique value no competitor offers

🎯 **Medium Impact:**
4. **Voice Interface** - Table stakes for modern AI tools
5. **Advanced Integrations** - IDE plugins, Slack/Teams

### 3. **Pricing Strategy**

**Recommended Approach:**

| Tier | Price | Positioning vs. Competitors |
|------|-------|----------------------------|
| **Free Trial** | $0 (30 days) | Match Cursor, beat Copilot (no trial) |
| **Individual Pro** | $15-20/month | Match ChatGPT Plus, below Copilot Business |
| **Team Lead** | $30-35/month | Below Copilot Business ($39), competitive with Claude Team |
| **Enterprise** | $50-60/month | Significantly below enterprise AI tools ($100+) |

**Alternative:** Launch at $15/month to undercut ChatGPT Plus, increase to $20 after adding Score 2 features

### 4. **Positioning Messages by Competitor**

**vs. GitHub Copilot:**
> "Copilot knows JavaScript. MC Press Chatbot knows your RPG codebase—and the 25 years of MC Press expertise behind it."

**vs. ChatGPT Plus:**
> "ChatGPT guesses at IBM i. We know IBM i. Upload your RPG code and see the difference proprietary content makes."

**vs. Codeium (Free):**
> "Free tools give you generic answers. MC Press gives you answers that save hours—every day. Calculate your ROI with our analytics dashboard."

**vs. Cursor:**
> "Cursor makes you switch editors. MC Press works wherever you are—web, mobile, or integrated into your existing workflow."
