## High Risk Requiring Attention

### TECH-001: Incomplete Removal Causing Runtime Errors
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Search components may be referenced in multiple locations not documented  
**Impact**: High - Could cause application crashes or broken pages  

**Affected Components**:
- Frontend Layout components
- Navigation menus
- Route configurations
- Backend API routers

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Perform comprehensive grep search for all search-related imports
- Use feature flag to disable before removing code
- Test all pages and routes before deployment
- Keep rollback commit ready

**Testing Requirements**:
- Full regression test of all pages
- API endpoint testing for 404/410 responses
- Browser console error monitoring
- Load testing to ensure no performance degradation

## Medium Risks

### TECH-002: Breaking Existing Chat Functionality
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Chat and search may share common utilities  
**Impact**: Medium - Core functionality disruption  

**Mitigation**:
- Review shared dependencies carefully
- Test chat functionality extensively
- Maintain separation of concerns

### OPS-001: Deployment Rollback Complications  
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Railway platform constraints  
**Impact**: Medium - Extended downtime if rollback needed  

**Mitigation**:
- Test deployment process in staging
- Document rollback procedure
- Have previous Docker image ready

### BUS-001: User Confusion from Missing Feature
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Users may expect search functionality  
**Impact**: Medium - Support tickets and user frustration  

**Mitigation**:
- Add clear messaging about using chat for queries
- Update help documentation proactively
- Consider adding a tooltip explaining the change

## Low Risks

### TECH-003: Missed Search Dependencies
**Score: 2 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low - Code is well-structured  
**Impact**: Medium - May cause build failures  

**Mitigation**:
- Use TypeScript compiler to catch import errors
- Run build process locally before committing

### OPS-002: CDN Cache Inconsistency
**Score: 1 (Low)**  
**Probability**: Low - Netlify handles cache invalidation  
**Impact**: Low - Temporary UI inconsistency  

**Mitigation**:
- Clear CDN cache after deployment
- Monitor for user reports of old UI

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
1. **Complete Page Navigation Test**
   - Navigate every page in the application
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify no broken links or references

2. **API Endpoint Testing**
   - Test all `/search` endpoints return 410 Gone
   - Verify redirects work correctly
   - Ensure no 500 errors

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests  
1. **Chat Functionality Regression**
   - Send various chat messages
   - Upload documents
   - Test conversation history

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Test on various screen sizes
   - Ensure navigation menu works without search

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
1. **Build and Deployment**
   - Local build verification
   - Staging deployment test
   - Performance benchmarking

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- Ensure zero console errors on all pages
- Verify chat functionality completely unaffected
- Update all documentation references

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- User messaging about feature change
- Support team briefing
- Monitoring alerts configured

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Error rate spikes in application logs
- 404/410 response rates
- User feedback channels
- Chat usage patterns

## Risk Summary for Gate

    title: 'Incomplete removal causing runtime errors'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Comprehensive search for all search-related code references'
      - 'Full regression testing before production deployment'
    monitor:
      - 'Error rates post-deployment'
      - 'User feedback for confusion'
```

## Recommendation

This is a **LOW-MEDIUM RISK** cleanup task that can proceed with careful implementation. The primary risk is incomplete removal causing runtime errors. With proper testing and a staged deployment approach, these risks are manageable. The cleanup will improve system maintainability by removing non-functional code.
