# Bmad for IBM i - Project Brief

**Date:** August 11, 2025  
**Project Name:** Bmad for IBM i Developers  
**Project Type:** Strategic Platform Development  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

**Vision:** Create the first comprehensive AI-powered workflow orchestration platform specifically designed for IBM i developers, based on the proven bmad agent architecture.

**Market Opportunity:** The IBM i development market faces a critical workforce crisis (average developer age 70, retiring by 2030) while existing solutions focus narrowly on AI coding assistance rather than complete workflow orchestration.

**Competitive Advantage:** While IBM Code Assist offers AI coding for $3,000/month enterprise-only, we provide complete development workflow orchestration targeting the underserved 70% mid-market segment.

**Strategic Positioning:** "Complete development workflow orchestration for IBM i teams" vs. "AI coding assistant for RPG"

## Market Context

### Critical Market Drivers
- **Aging Workforce Crisis**: 70% of RPG developers expected to retire by 2030
- **Knowledge Transfer Emergency**: Decades of tribal knowledge at risk of being lost
- **Mid-Market Gap**: 70% of IBM i shops underserved by enterprise-only solutions
- **Modernization Pressure**: Legacy systems require understanding before transformation

### Competitive Landscape
- **IBM watsonx Code Assistant for i**: $3,000/month, enterprise-focused, AI coding only
- **GitHub Copilot**: $10-39/month, general-purpose, limited RPG knowledge
- **Legacy Modernization Tools**: Complex, expensive, focused on transformation not daily development
- **Market Gap**: No comprehensive workflow orchestration for IBM i development

### Revenue Opportunity
- **Year 1**: $21K MRR (50 developers + 5 teams)
- **Year 2**: $60K MRR (200 developers + 20 teams + 3 enterprises)
- **Year 3**: $150K MRR (500+ developers + training revenue + marketplace)
