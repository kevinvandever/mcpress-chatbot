## Phase 1: Warm-up & Wide Exploration

### Technique: Mind Mapping - "What If" Scenarios

**Initial "What If" Ideas Generated:**
1. **Code Debugging Assistant** - Upload requirements docs + code examples, chatbot debugs the code
2. **RPG-Style Code Generation** - Generate working code templates from ideas (RPG vibe coding)
3. **Certification & Assessment Platform** - Generate quizzes/certification questions, MC Press certification path
4. **Open to expansion** - Receptive to additional breakthrough ideas

**Expansion on Irresistible Value:**
- **Complete Development Assistant** - Beyond debugging: process test scenarios from requirements, create docs, test plans, sample code
- **End-to-End Workflow Bot** - Like "Mary for developers" - input idea/notes → outputs docs, test plan, sample code, debugging
- **Comprehensive RPG Development Suite** - Full lifecycle support for RPG development process
- **Partnership Evolution** - Expanding beyond David's original vision of chatbot over published works
- **Certification as Engagement** - Fun factor more important than revenue potential

**Ultimate Platform Vision:**
- **"Bmad for IBM i Developers"** - Multiple specialized agents for IBM i ecosystem
- **Complete Technology Stack Coverage** - RPG IV, RPG-Free, CL, DDS, SQL expertise
- **Full Development Lifecycle** - Specifications, test plans, coding, debugging in one platform
- **IBM i-Specific GitHub Alternative** - Features tailored for IBM i that don't exist in mainstream tools
- **Competitive Intelligence** - IBM Code Assist early access pending, unknown capabilities
- **Vision Evolution** - Massive expansion from original PDF chatbot concept

## Phase 2: Competitive Analysis & Monetization Strategy

### Competitive Landscape Key Findings:
- **IBM watsonx Code Assistant for i** - Main competitor at $3,000/month enterprise pricing
- **GitHub Copilot** - General purpose but limited RPG training ($10-39/month)
- **Market Gap** - Mid-market IBM i shops underserved (70% of market)
- **Crisis Opportunity** - Aging RPG workforce (avg age 70, retiring by 2030)
- **Limited AI Solutions** - Only IBM offers specialized RPG AI assistance

### Monetization Strategy Options:
1. **Tiered SaaS** - Developer ($29), Team ($149), Enterprise ($999) - undercut IBM pricing
2. **Knowledge Transfer Revenue** - RPG bootcamps ($2,500), documentation services ($50-100/hr)
3. **Freemium Model** - Free basic features, premium AI capabilities
4. **Marketplace Revenue** - Templates, consulting partnerships, integrations

### Revenue Projections:
- Year 1: $21K MRR (50 dev + 5 team subscriptions)
- Year 2: $60K MRR (200 dev + 20 team + 3 enterprise)  
- Year 3: $150K MRR (500 dev + 50 team + 10 enterprise + training)

**Strategic Advantage**: Price disruption opportunity against IBM's enterprise-only focus

## Phase 3: Strategic Architecture Decision - "Bmad for IBM i"

### Key Insight: Clone & Adapt Bmad Framework
- **Foundation**: Leverage existing bmad agent architecture and orchestration engine  
- **Positioning**: "Complete development workflow orchestration for IBM i teams"
- **Differentiation**: Workflow breadth vs IBM Code Assist's coding focus

### Proposed Agent Specializations:
1. **RPGMaster** - Coding, modernization, debugging specialist
2. **SystemAnalyst** - Requirements elicitation ("Mary for developers") 
3. **DataArchitect** - Database modernization and optimization
4. **ModernizationGuide** - Legacy transformation expert

### Implementation Strategy:
- **Phase 1**: Fork bmad, adapt one agent (likely SystemAnalyst)
- **Phase 2**: Add IBM i-specific knowledge base and templates
- **Phase 3**: Build full agent suite and market differentiation

### Knowledge Base Challenge:
- **Current Assets**: 115 MC Press PDFs (good start but not exhaustive)
- **Need**: Comprehensive IBM i patterns, best practices, business domain knowledge
- **Opportunity**: Community-driven knowledge building approach

### Phase 1 Implementation Plan: AI-Assisted PDF Extraction
**Immediate Action**: Systematically extract IBM i patterns from 115 MC Press PDFs using LLMs
**Target Agent**: SystemAnalyst - requirements elicitation and system design
**Future Discussion**: Community beta, expert partnerships, hybrid approaches with business partner

### Knowledge Extraction Strategy:
1. **RPG Code Patterns** - Extract common idioms, error handling, best practices
2. **Business Process Patterns** - Manufacturing, distribution, financial workflows  
3. **System Design Patterns** - File structures, program organization, integration approaches
4. **Requirements Templates** - Common IBM i project types and their specifications
