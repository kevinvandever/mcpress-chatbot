## Phase 1: Warm-up & Wide Exploration

### Technique: Mind Mapping - "What If" Scenarios

**Initial "What If" Ideas Generated:**
1. **Code Debugging Assistant** - Upload requirements docs + code examples, chatbot debugs the code
2. **RPG-Style Code Generation** - Generate working code templates from ideas (RPG vibe coding)
3. **Certification & Assessment Platform** - Generate quizzes/certification questions, MC Press certification path
4. **Open to expansion** - Receptive to additional breakthrough ideas

**Expansion on Irresistible Value:**
- **Complete Development Assistant** - Beyond debugging: process test scenarios from requirements, create docs, test plans, sample code
- **End-to-End Workflow Bot** - Like "Mary for developers" - input idea/notes → outputs docs, test plan, sample code, debugging
- **Comprehensive RPG Development Suite** - Full lifecycle support for RPG development process
- **Partnership Evolution** - Expanding beyond David's original vision of chatbot over published works
- **Certification as Engagement** - Fun factor more important than revenue potential

**Ultimate Platform Vision:**
- **"Bmad for IBM i Developers"** - Multiple specialized agents for IBM i ecosystem
- **Complete Technology Stack Coverage** - RPG IV, RPG-Free, CL, DDS, SQL expertise
- **Full Development Lifecycle** - Specifications, test plans, coding, debugging in one platform
- **IBM i-Specific GitHub Alternative** - Features tailored for IBM i that don't exist in mainstream tools
- **Competitive Intelligence** - IBM Code Assist early access pending, unknown capabilities
- **Vision Evolution** - Massive expansion from original PDF chatbot concept
