## üöÄ Next Session: Frontend Implementation

### Objective
Build the code upload user interface with drag-drop, file management, and quota tracking.

### Tasks (Estimated 2-3 hours)

#### 1. Create Main Page (30 min)
**File**: `/Users/kevinvandever/kev-dev/mcpress-chatbot/frontend/app/code-analysis/upload/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Page structure:
// - Page header with title and instructions
// - CodeUploadZone component (drag-drop area)
// - UploadQuotaIndicator component (quota display)
// - CodeFileList component (uploaded files)
// - Integration with /api/code/* endpoints
```

#### 2. Build Components (90 min)

**Component 1: CodeUploadZone** (30 min)
- File: `frontend/components/CodeUploadZone.tsx`
- Features: Drag-drop using `react-dropzone`, file type validation, size validation
- Reference: `frontend/components/FileUpload.tsx` (existing pattern)

**Component 2: CodeFileList** (20 min)
- File: `frontend/components/CodeFileList.tsx`
- Features: List uploaded files, show status, delete files, preview button
- Reference: `frontend/components/DocumentList.tsx` (existing pattern)

**Component 3: CodeFilePreview** (20 min)
- File: `frontend/components/CodeFilePreview.tsx`
- Features: Syntax-highlighted code preview using `react-syntax-highlighter`
- Reference: Story requirements specify RPG/RPGLE/CL highlighting

**Component 4: UploadQuotaIndicator** (10 min)
- File: `frontend/components/UploadQuotaIndicator.tsx`
- Features: Progress bar showing files/storage used vs limits
- Display: "5/50 files uploaded today" + "10MB/100MB storage used"

**Component 5: FileTypeIndicator** (10 min)
- File: `frontend/components/FileTypeIndicator.tsx`
- Features: Badge/icon showing file type (.rpg, .cl, .sql, etc.)
- Styling: Use MC Press colors (navy #000080, coral #FF6B35)

#### 3. Add Routing (10 min)
- Add link to code upload page in main navigation
- Update layout if needed

#### 4. Test & Polish (20 min)
- Test responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Test drag-drop interactions
- Verify quota display updates
- Check error handling UI

## üß™ Testing After Frontend Complete

### Production Testing Checklist
Once frontend is deployed to Netlify and backend to Railway:

1. **Functional Tests**
   - [ ] Upload single .rpg file
   - [ ] Upload multiple files (drag multiple)
   - [ ] Preview uploaded file (syntax highlighting works)
   - [ ] Delete file
   - [ ] View quota usage updates
   - [ ] Test file type restrictions (upload .exe should fail)
   - [ ] Test size limit (upload 11MB file should fail)

2. **Quota Tests**
   - [ ] Upload 50 files to hit daily limit
   - [ ] Verify 51st file is rejected with quota message
   - [ ] Upload 100MB to hit storage limit
   - [ ] Verify additional upload rejected

3. **Security Tests**
   - [ ] Try accessing without authentication (should redirect to login)
   - [ ] Try accessing another user's files (should get 403)
   - [ ] Upload file with suspicious content (check security scan)

4. **24-Hour Expiration Test**
   - [ ] Upload file, note timestamp
   - [ ] Wait 25 hours, verify file deleted automatically
   - [ ] Check database (deleted_at should be set)

## üêõ Known Issues & Notes

### Backend
- ‚úÖ All backend code complete and integrated
- ‚úÖ Database migration successful
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Local testing skipped** - production testing planned instead

## ü§ù Handoff to Next Session

**Dexter**: Ready to continue building! Next session, start by creating the main page at `frontend/app/code-analysis/upload/page.tsx`, then build the 5 components one by one. Reference existing patterns in `FileUpload.tsx` and `DocumentList.tsx` for consistency.

**Kevin**: When you're ready, just say "continue story-006 frontend" and I'll pick up where we left off!
