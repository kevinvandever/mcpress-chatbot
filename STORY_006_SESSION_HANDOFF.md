# Story-006 Session Handoff - October 14, 2025 (Evening)

## Session Summary

**QA Agent**: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
**Session Duration**: ~4 hours
**Status**: In Progress - Private Beta Mode Implementation
**Next Session**: Testing & QA validation

---

## What We Accomplished Today

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Three Critical Bugs**:
   - **BUG-006-001**: Netlify 404 errors (fixed netlify.toml base directory)
   - **BUG-006-002**: Authentication tokens not sent (created axios interceptor)
   - **BUG-006-003**: Dashboard showing 0 docs instead of 115 (fixed admin pages auth)

2. **Refactored Authentication Architecture**:
   - Replaced admin auth with guest auth for code upload
   - Created `backend/guest_auth.py` for lightweight guest authentication
   - Created `frontend/utils/guestAuth.ts` for auto-generating guest UUIDs
   - Updated axios interceptor to handle both admin and guest auth

3. **Implemented Private Beta Mode**:
   - Added `GUEST_ACCESS_ENABLED` environment flag
   - When `false`: Requires admin login for code upload (secure testing)
   - When `true`: Allows public guest access (future public launch)
   - Committed to production (commit 017963b)

## 🔴 Outstanding Issues

### Issue 1: Wrong Login Redirect
**Problem**: When visiting `/code-analysis/upload` without auth, user is redirected to "user app password entry" instead of `/admin/login`

**Expected Behavior**: Should redirect to `/admin/login`

**Possible Causes**:
- Frontend axios interceptor might be redirecting incorrectly
- There may be a separate auth check on the upload page component
- The "user app password entry" page needs investigation

**Location to Check**:
- `frontend/config/axios.ts` lines 64-75 (response interceptor)
- `frontend/app/code-analysis/upload/page.tsx` (check for auth guards)
- Look for any other redirect logic in the app

### Issue 2: Dashboard Still Shows 0 Documents
**Problem**: Admin dashboard shows 0 documents instead of 115

**What We Fixed**: Updated `frontend/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` and `frontend/app/admin/documents/page.tsx` to use `apiClient` (commit 5b83197)

**Status**: Fix deployed to Netlify but still showing 0 documents

**Possible Causes**:
- Browser cache not cleared
- Netlify deployment incomplete
- API endpoint returning wrong data
- Frontend parsing issue

**Next Steps**:
1. Hard refresh dashboard page (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check browser Network tab - is `/api/documents` being called?
3. Check `/api/documents` response - does it have 115 documents?
4. Check console for errors

## Environment Setup Required

### Railway Environment Variable

**Variable Name**: `GUEST_ACCESS_ENABLED`
**Value**: `false`
**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS TO BE SET IN RAILWAY

**Instructions**:
1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Open `mcpress-chatbot-production` project
3. Click backend service
4. Go to "Variables" tab
5. Add: `GUEST_ACCESS_ENABLED=false`
6. Wait 2 minutes for redeploy

## Testing Checklist for Tomorrow

### Priority 1: Fix Authentication Flow

- [ ] **Test 1**: Visit `/code-analysis/upload` in incognito
  - Expected: Redirect to `/admin/login`
  - Actual: Redirects to "user app password entry"
  - **Fix needed**: Identify what "user app password entry" is and update redirect logic

- [ ] **Test 2**: Set `GUEST_ACCESS_ENABLED=false` in Railway
  - Wait for deployment (~2 min)
  - Test redirect behavior again

- [ ] **Test 3**: Login with admin credentials
  - Should be able to access `/code-analysis/upload`
  - Should be able to upload files

### Priority 2: Fix Dashboard Documents

- [ ] **Test 4**: Hard refresh admin dashboard
  - Clear browser cache completely
  - Open `/admin/dashboard` in incognito
  - Check if 115 documents appear

- [ ] **Test 5**: Check API directly
  ```bash
  curl -X GET "https://mcpress-chatbot-production.up.railway.app/documents" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
  ```
  - Verify response has 115 documents

- [ ] **Test 6**: Check browser Network tab
  - Is `/documents` or `/admin/stats` being called?
  - What's the response?

### Priority 3: Story-006 QA Testing

Once auth is working:

- [ ] **Upload Test**: Upload a sample .rpgle file
- [ ] **Quota Test**: Verify quota indicator updates
- [ ] **Preview Test**: Preview uploaded file
- [ ] **Delete Test**: Delete uploaded file
- [ ] **Session Test**: Verify session creation

## Known Technical Debt

1. **Authentication Complexity**: Now have 3 auth modes (admin, guest, private beta) - needs cleanup
2. **Redirect Logic**: Multiple redirect paths causing confusion
3. **Dashboard Issue**: 115 documents mystery needs root cause analysis
4. **No Automated Tests**: All testing is manual (Story-006 DoD requires automated tests)

## Architecture Overview

### Authentication Modes:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Admin Features (/admin/*)                          │
│  - Uses: adminToken (Bearer JWT)                    │
│  - Storage: localStorage.adminToken                 │
│  - Endpoints: /admin/login, /admin/upload, etc.     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Code Upload (/code-analysis/upload)                │
│                                                      │
│  IF GUEST_ACCESS_ENABLED=false (Private Beta):      │
│    - Uses: adminToken (Bearer JWT)                  │
│    - Requires admin login                           │
│                                                      │
│  IF GUEST_ACCESS_ENABLED=true (Public):             │
│    - Uses: guestUserId (UUID in X-Guest-User-Id)    │
│    - Storage: localStorage.guestUserId              │
│    - Auto-generated on first visit                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Main Chat (/)                                       │
│  - Currently: No auth (public)                      │
│  - Future: Behind MCPress SSO                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Axios Interceptor Logic:

```typescript
// frontend/config/axios.ts

Request Interceptor:
  IF url.includes('/admin/'):
    → Add: Authorization: Bearer ${adminToken}
  ELSE IF url.includes('/api/code/') AND NOT '/api/code/admin/':
    → Add: X-Guest-User-Id: ${guestUserId}
  ELSE:
    → No auth headers

Response Interceptor (401 errors):
  IF url.includes('/admin/'):
    → Clear adminToken
    → Redirect to /admin/login
  ELSE IF url.includes('/api/code/'):
    → Log error
    → Show friendly message
```

## Questions to Investigate Tomorrow

1. **What is the "user app password entry" page?**
   - Where is it defined?
   - Why is it intercepting the redirect?
   - Should it be removed or integrated?

2. **Why are documents still showing 0?**
   - Is it a caching issue?
   - Is the API endpoint broken?
   - Is the frontend parsing broken?

3. **Should we simplify the auth architecture?**
   - Too many auth modes now (admin, guest, private beta)
   - Consider consolidating before finishing Story-006

2. ✅ Fix dashboard showing 0 documents (should show 115)
3. ✅ Set `GUEST_ACCESS_ENABLED=false` in Railway
4. ✅ Test complete upload flow with admin auth

### Should Complete:
5. ⏳ Execute basic QA test plan (upload, preview, delete, quota)
6. ⏳ Verify all 11 `/api/code/*` endpoints work
7. ⏳ Test mobile responsiveness

### Nice to Have:
8. 📋 Write automated tests
9. 📋 Clean up auth architecture
10. 📋 Update Story-006 status to "Ready for Review"

## Notes for Tomorrow

**Kevin's Concerns**:
- ✅ Wants site secure during testing (private beta mode addresses this)
- ❓ Confused by redirect to "user app password entry" instead of admin login
- ❓ Dashboard still showing 0 documents despite fix

**Architecture Decisions Made**:
- Code upload is USER-facing (not admin-only)
- Private beta mode via environment flag (clean, professional)
- Guest auth ready for future MCPress SSO integration
- All code has TODO comments for SSO migration

**Good to Know**:
- All backend changes auto-deploy via Railway (no manual deploy needed)
- Frontend changes auto-deploy via Netlify (watch build logs)
- Browser cache is your enemy - always test in incognito

## Success Criteria for Story-006

From `story-006-code-file-upload.md`:

### Must Pass:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met (file upload, validation, quota, preview, delete)
- [ ] All security tests passed (auth, cross-user access, file validation)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<3s upload for 1MB file)
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] 24-hour auto-cleanup verified

### Current Status:
- Backend: 100% ✅
- Frontend: 100% ✅ (code complete)
- Deployment: 90% ⚠️ (auth issues blocking testing)
- QA Testing: 10% ⏳ (blocked by auth issues)

---

**End of Session Handoff**

Good luck tomorrow, Kevin! Start with fixing the redirect issue and the dashboard documents. Once those are resolved, the rest of QA testing should go smoothly.
